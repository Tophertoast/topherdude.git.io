<h1> How would you describe her?</h1>


<p style="color:darkblack;">Well, my home basically i love everything about this woman, to the way she carries herself
the way she is one of the intellectual person to have
    conversations with. You can just talk to her about anything. Shes shy, don't take that
as a personal attack just give her time to get to know you, she really will hear your problems
not just pretened to get away from you. She is a hard worker, very dedicated to getting the job
done. </p>

<h2>When did you fall in love with her </h2>

<p>There was one day I recall in september I got a call from my best friend Marcus
    telling me "to get my ass ready Him, a cousin and I are going to Halloween Store
    to get our rave suits." I thought fuck it, sounds fun im always down to hangout
    with Marcus and I though his cousin Matt. Well to my shock Marcus shows up to
    my parents house with the most beautiful woman i've ever seen I tell you till
    this day, I always wonder why Marcus never introduced me to her, even just to
    hangout. Cheyanna told me the antics her and Marcus got in too, well it sounds
    like stuff Marcus and I did minus hopping fences and smoking pot lol.
    So I never expected a girl coming over.
    The moment I seen her I felt my heart go up rapidly I was nervous to speak besides a formal
    hello. By the time we were all done hanging out I thought to myself wow this girl is Awesome
    I would like to get to know her. Then the rest is history hanging out eating candy, watching
    scary movies. Me and Cheyanna get along very well to the point were dating her is like dating
    your best friend no bullshit just good vibes.</P>

<h2>What are things you can expect from Cheyanna?</h2>
<p>Well, miss Rose has one of the best work ethics i've ever seen. No only will she get her
work done with speed, but she will double, triple check to make sure, even going to ask if
shes not sure. You can expect her to take her work responsibilties very serious she is a very
qualified and educated for a postion of this stature. Cheyanna even makes me question my own
work ethic make me the best person I can be for the postion im in</p>

<h3>Good luck in your interview, I love you my dear.</h3>
